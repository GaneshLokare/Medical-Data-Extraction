# Medical Data Extraction

### Problem Statement:
Hospitals need to submit some documents such as medical prescription, patient details to the insurance companies to claim health insurance,
Insurance companies receives scanned documents from either hospitals or individual doctors, Insurance companies have scaneed images of these documents and want to extract the meaningfull information such as patient name, medical problem from it for further process.

Extracting information manually is not efficient because volume of documents varies, like in case of pandamic or flue there will be more documents. Handling this variantion is dificult because if we have more volume then we require more human resource and viceversa. And if companies not increase human resources then it lead to delays.

### Solution Provided:
We are building software to extract data from images using pytesseract and opencv.
